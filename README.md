# HawkerTown

## Motivation
Through our interactions with hawkers, we realised that many hawkers dread managing their invoices and finances as they can become confusing and tedious to keep track of and often gets very messy. Hawkers often report having trouble calculating and gathering their finances in one place, and they constantly need to update their invoices which requires tedious calculations etc. 

Another problem faced by hawkers is that they have many different suppliers for their ingredients, which makes it hard to track. Due to the ever-increasing prices of supplies, hawkers would want to have the most bang for buck. However, most of them do not have the contacts or connections, and would hence stick with their current supplier, even though the prices may no longer be justifiable.

Furthermore, there are instances where hawkers report that the suppliers forgot their orders or missed out on certain supplies. It appears that suppliers also have trouble tracking their customers' orders and might forget about them which will definitely affect their reputation in the long run. Apart from that, some suppliers, especially those who just started the business, are also unable to attract enough customers due to their lack of connections, which will affect their sales. 

Hence, we propose to develop a website that allows the users (hawkers and supplies) to better manage their business with the various features.

## Aim
We hope to create a web app that offers a one-stop solution for hawkers and suppliers to connect which will make running their business more efficient.
